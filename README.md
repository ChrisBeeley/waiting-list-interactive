# Elective care waiting times interactive app

#### Project Status: [In progress]

## Project Description and data sources

Following the PM's pledge to shrink the waiting list by the next general election, we are developing an interactive app which shows how the waiting list has changed based on the numbers of new referrals to elective care and numbers of outflow per month. 

## How does it work?

This relies on publicly-available referral to treatment data (https://www.england.nhs.uk/statistics/statistical-work-areas/rtt-waiting-times/).

### Requirements

These scripts were written in R version 4.0.2 and RStudio Version 1.1.383. 
The following R packages (available on CRAN) are needed: 
* [**tidyverse**](https://www.tidyverse.org/)
* [**janitor**]
* [**Shiny**]
* [**readxl**]
* [**zoo**]

The list above is non exhaustive, but each of the individual .R codes in this repository indicates which packages are needed.
